This was a personal project I undertook to practice making a wordcloud in python.  I included the wordcloud in a tableau dashboard I made that displays how favorably (or unfavorably) countries view three specific disneyland locations (California, Paris and Hong Kong).  The jpg used to shape the wordcloud is included above as well as the python3 code.
